# Agent Guidelines

Welcome! Review the files in `docs/` for product context, architectural notes, and coding conventions before making any substantive changes.

## Development Practices
- Favor small, focused commits and clearly describe your changes.
- Keep changes within scope; open follow-up tasks for large refactors.
- Ensure new or modified code is covered by existing tests or add new ones as needed.
- Run the relevant test suite(s) before committing.

## Pull Requests
- Summarize user-facing and technical changes succinctly.
- Reference any docs or decisions from `docs/` that guided your work.

Thanks for contributing!
