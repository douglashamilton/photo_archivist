# Agent Guidelines

Welcome! 

## Navigation

Review the following folders before suggesting or making any substantive changes:
- Instructions for you (the agent) in `./.agent/`
- Product requirement specs and technical design documents in `./docs/`

## Development Practices
- Favor small, focused commits and clearly describe your changes.
- Keep changes within scope; open follow-up tasks for large refactors.
- Ensure new or modified code is covered by existing tests or add new ones as needed.
- Run the relevant test suite(s) before committing.
- Where files have been created that **should not** be version-controlled, update .gitignore accordingly. 

## Pull Requests
- Summarize user-facing and technical changes succinctly.
- Reference any docs or decisions from the `docs/` folder that guided your work.
