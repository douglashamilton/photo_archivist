# Research Instructions

**Prerequisites**
- Collect the full project intake directly from the user before writing anything.

**Deliverable**
- `docs/prd.md`, following `templates/PRD-template.md`.

**Next Action**
- Confirm the PRD exists, share the path, and ask the user for review or updates.

## Step 1

Ask the user to provide the following information:
* **Project name:** {{Name}}
* **One-sentence objective:** {{Objective}}
* **Target users & top jobs:** {{Primary personas, top 2–3 jobs-to-be-done}}
* **Core problem / use cases:** {{Pain points, primary scenarios}}
* **Top user journeys:** {{2–3 "When…, they need to…, so that…" examples}}
* **Must-have capabilities (MVP):** {{Critical outcomes or features}}
* **Nice-to-have ideas:** {{Deferred or experimental ideas}}
* **Constraints & guardrails:** {{Regulatory, performance, platform, timeline, budget}}
* **Data inputs & quality notes:** {{Available data sets, gaps, privacy considerations}}
* **Known assets & dependencies:** {{Existing APIs, repos, design systems, stakeholders}}
* **Known risks or blockers:** {{Issues we should watch for}}
* **Assumptions already in play:** {{What must be true for success}}
* **Non-goals / out of scope:** {{Explicit exclusions}}
* **Success metrics (business & user):** {{KPIs, UX outcomes}}
* **Open questions for research/design:** {{Outstanding questions they need answered}}
* **Depth:** {{brief | standard | deep}} (default: standard)

## Step 2

Synthesise the intake and produce the PRD using `templates/PRD-template.md`. Save it to `../docs/prd.md`.

## Step 3

Notify the user that `docs/prd.md` is ready, highlight any open questions, and request feedback or changes.
