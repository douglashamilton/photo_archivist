# Research Instructions

## Step 1

Ask the user to input the following information before proceeding with the research:
* **Project name:** {{Name}}

* **Core problem / use cases:** {{Problem / use cases}}
* **Constraints (must/should):** {{Platforms, data residency, security, budget/time}}
* **Known assets:** {{Existing data/APIs, repos, design, brand, domains}}
* **Environments:** {{Web/mobile/desktop/CLI; OS; cloud}}
* **Non-goals / out of scope:** {{Non-goals}}

## Step 2

Synthesise the input information and perform deep research. Produce a product requirements document (PRD) as per the following format: `...agent/PRD-template.md`. Write the PRD in markdown format to the following folder: `../docs/` with the filename `prd.md`. 

## Step 3

Once the PRD is created, inform the user that the PRD has been created and provide the path to the document. Request that the user review the PRD, and provide feedback by addressing the open questions or request any changes if necessary.
