# Planning Instructions

## Step 1

Read the PRD and TDD both located in the `../docs/` folder. If either document does not exist, inform the user that the documents are missing and request that they complete the previous steps first. 

## Step 2

Based on the PRD and TDD, create a development **plan** according to the format in `./.agent/plan-template.md`. Write the plan in markdown format to the following folder: `../docs/` with the filename `plan.md`.

## Step 3

Once the plan is created, inform the user that the plan has been created and provide the path to the document. Request that the user review the plan, and provide feedback by addressing the open questions or request any changes if necessary.
