# Design Instructions

**Prerequisites**
- `docs/prd.md` must exist and be up to date. If missing, ask the user to complete Research Step 2 first.

**Deliverable**
- `docs/tdd.md`, produced from `templates/TDD-template.md`.

**Next Action**
- Share the TDD path, call out design decisions or open questions, and request user review.

## Step 1

Read `../docs/prd.md`. If it is missing or stale, pause and request the updated PRD.

## Step 2

Create the high-level technical design using `templates/TDD-template.md`. Save it as `../docs/tdd.md`.

## Step 3

Inform the user that `docs/tdd.md` is ready, summarise key design choices or open questions, and request feedback or changes.
