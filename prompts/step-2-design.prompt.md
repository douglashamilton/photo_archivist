# Design Instructions

## Step 1

Read the product requirements document (PRD) located at `../docs/prd.md`. If the PRD does not exist, inform the user that the PRD is missing and request that they complete Step 2 of the research instructions first.

## Step 2

Based on the PRD, create a high-level technical design document (TDD) based on the template in `./.agent/tdd-template.md`. Write the design document in markdown format to the following folder: `../docs/` with the filename `tdd.md`.

## Step 3

Once the PRD is created, inform the user that the TDD has been created and provide the path to the document. Request that the user review the TDD, and provide feedback by addressing the open questions or request any changes if necessary.
